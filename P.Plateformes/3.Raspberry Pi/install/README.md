# Installation

https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) is our official operating system for all models of the Raspberry Pi.
Use `Raspberry Pi Imager` for an easy way to install Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems to an SD card ready to use with your Raspberry Pi:

:computer: sur Windows

```
PS > choco install rpi-imager
```

:apple: sur MacOS

```
% brew cask install raspberry-pi-imager
```

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images

Boot your new OS
You can now insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it up.

For the official Raspberry Pi OS, if you need to manually log in, the default user name is `pi`, with password `raspberry`. Remember the default keyboard layout is set to UK.

You should change the default password straight away to ensure your Raspberry Pi is secure.
